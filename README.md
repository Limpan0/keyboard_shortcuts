This extension is made as a tool for new coders to learn usefull Keyboard Shortcuts (KBS) which in turn should result in faster code-editing. 
The sooner you learn KBS the sooner you will start saving time when coding.

## How to use: 
There are two ways to open the extension.

    1. Via Keyboard Shortcut
        - Windows: Shift + Alt + K
        - Mac: Command + Ctrl + K

        - Write "Keyboard Shortcuts"
        - Choose the option "Keyboard Shortcuts for Beginners" 

- Now you should keep the extension-window open while coding and toggle between the extension and your code file.
- In the beginning you should look at it frequently and try to use the commands as you code.
- When you have learned the KBS you can still look at the extension to refresh your memory of the commands.
